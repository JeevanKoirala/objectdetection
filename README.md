# objectdetection
Used libraries:
ultralyrics(yolo)
opencv
numpy
This project does is it recognizes the objects in the camera i have used yolov8x for the accurate work i could have used more advance version but you guys can see what my computer responds to the v8x so i didn't used that at first i had tried it with v8m only but it was too much unaccurate so i shifted to v8x which made this project much big you guys can just import the code to you idle and use that the v8x will be downloaded automatically and i have used youtube tutorial to make this and to shift to v8x i used AI....in order to run it in your system you guys need to have the used libraries first...
Enjoyyyy...
